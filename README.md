Feel Free to message me on Discord @ Alfie#6783 as I will be happy to help.
I'm currently working on a more simple V2 with a PCB designed to house the same layout but at a shorter build time (less soldering).

I used a KY040 Rotary Encoder, this comes attached to a breakout board that has some included resistors.

I desoldered this from the board and used it as just the encoder. I wired it into the plate/switch as can be seen from some of the images.

These are the exact Brass inserts I used, I believe you need around 25 of them.

I believe the GitHub has most of the images I took during the build but the rest are here on this imgur:

Remove 1x 1u switch/keycap as KLE counts the rotary encoder as a switch. I found that GMK-Ys keycaps on Aliexpress have all the required keycaps for this board.

The basic instructions aren't really instructions but an order to do stuff:

1) print both plates
2) Start printing all the other parts in whatever order
3) While printing, wire and solder switches to plate. ( it helps to have the lower base, centre leg and elite C tray at this point to work out where to wire the Elite C to)
4) Finish printing case parts and assemble, add brass inserts and paint it all. I used a few primer coats and then a few matte coats of grey and clear.
5) Flash firmware onto the elite C while its not in the case
6) Assemble all together and enjoy?

My best help would be to just give it a go and message me if confused, as i help people out I can add instructions and tips here. But to be honest this project was never built as a thing to share so i didnt document it very well and some things dont make much sense to anyone but me...

Good Luck Have Fun
